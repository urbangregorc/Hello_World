This is a story about Octocat!

Once upon a time lived a special cat. She had 8 legs and with those she could run 8 time...no, just 2 times faster than normal cats. Thus she was called Octocat.

She lived in a house with eight doors and 8 floors. Each of the floors had exactly 8 windows and at the roof there were 8 chimneys as well.
